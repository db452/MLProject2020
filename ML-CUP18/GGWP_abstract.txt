The model we've used to participate at MLCUP18 is created with Keras. We've chosen the hyperparameters with a GridSearchCV() in ScikitLearn, and after create the model with the Sequential()
object in Keras. For the cross-validation, we used a k value of 5. After several GridSearches, the hyperparameters are the following:

learn_rate = 0.01; hidden_layer_size = 14; dropout = 0.0; momentum = 0.7; nesterov = True; epochs = 1024; batch_size = 809; alpha= 0.0001
(N.B.: test with dropout is made after GS, beacause scikit MLPRegressor() doesn't support this parameter)

The model has reached a TR Loss of 2.9683 (and 3.5121 on TS), from the initial hyperparameters combination (from the first GS) with TR Loss of 5.2081.
