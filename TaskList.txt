Move gridsearch of SVM & KNN to Gridsearch folder.

Find optimal hyperparameters for concurrent SVM & KNN (should be the same)

Get MLP to run with current file system

Perform test regression with SVM & KNN with other dataset (aka not MLCup)

Perform test regression with MLP (aka not MLCup)

Find optimal hyperparameters using gridsearch for all 3 models

Use best model. Pray to god!







!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!OPTIONAL!!! (Nico?)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Find third model, if uses different tool (not pandas, sklearn) even better. Perform same steps as above. If best model,
use for MLCup.
