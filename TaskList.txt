Move gridsearch of SVM & KNN to Gridsearch folder. -Done

Find optimal hyperparameters for concurrent SVM & KNN (should be the same)-Done

Rewrite gridsearch to print best hyperparams to file and run overnight - Done

Perform test regression with SVM & KNN with other dataset (aka not MLCup)- Done

Get MLP to run with current file system

Perform test regression with MLP (aka not MLCup)

Find optimal hyperparameters using gridsearch for all 3 models -Partially Done

Use best model. Pray to god!







!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!OPTIONAL!!! (Nico?)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Find third model, if uses different tool (not pandas, sklearn) even better. Perform same steps as above. If best model,
use for MLCup.
