Move gridsearch of SVM & KNN to Gridsearch folder. -Done

Find optimal hyperparameters for concurrent SVM & KNN (should be the same)-Done

Rewrite gridsearch to print best hyperparams to file and run overnight - Done

Perform test regression with SVM & KNN with other dataset (aka not MLCup)- Done

Get MLP to run with current file system

Perform test regression with MLP (aka not MLCup)

Find optimal hyperparameters using gridsearch for all 3 models -Partially Done


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!REPORT!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Add explanation of hyperparameters
show examples of gridsearch code


Add graphs pertaining to new models
predict MLCUP values with model - done




DO AT THE END - IF TIME IS STILL AVAILABLE
Find third model, if uses different tool (not pandas, sklearn) even better. Perform same steps as above. If best model,
use for MLCup.
